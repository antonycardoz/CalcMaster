Sure, here's a suggestion for a README page for your `CalcMaster` project:

# CalcMaster

`CalcMaster` is a simple, yet powerful calculator app built with Kotlin for Android. It features a clean and intuitive user interface with a pleasant green theme, making calculations a breeze.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Supports decimal calculations.
- Clear and delete functions to correct mistakes.
- Displays the calculation process and result.

## Code Structure

The main code for the calculator logic is contained in the `MainActivity.kt` file in the `com.example.pinky` package. The `MainActivity` class extends `AppCompatActivity` and overrides the `onCreate` method to initialize the calculator buttons and set up their click listeners.

Each button appends its corresponding value to the input expression, which is then evaluated when the equals button is clicked. The result is displayed in the output TextView.

The `showResult` method is used to evaluate the input expression using the `Expression` class from the `mxparser` library. If the result is not a number (e.g., in case of a division by zero), an error message is displayed.

## Usage

To use the calculator, simply input your expression using the calculator buttons and press the equals button to evaluate the expression. You can clear the input and output fields using the clear button, and remove the last character from the input field using the delete button.

## Future Work

Future updates will include more advanced mathematical functions and the ability to switch between different themes.
